		<br/>
		<p> My name is felipe, I'm a Brazilian exchange student at Purdue university <br/>
			I came to the U.S. in January 2014 to live here for one year. Since that day I've learned a lot, not only academicaly speaking but personally too. <br/>
			My main major is Information Systems, but here I'm taking courses in CNIT (Computer and Information Technology) and some courses in CS (computer science).<br/>
			During the summer I'm taking a course called system administration. We are learning about windows server administration. So far the course is really good.<br/>
			Next semester will probably be a more challenger semester, but I believe it will be very interesting too.
